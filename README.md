# Double-Linked-List
- This repository is created to understand how to use double linked list basic operations
- Double linked list is mainly use to overcome the issue of reaching previous node which is not possible in single linked list.
- Since it is a data structure which uses dynamic memory allocation and is also efficient.
- One of the best real time example/application for double linked list is UNDO/REDO.
- This repo contains 2 files they are "doubly_list.h" which is a header file that contains all operation functions.
- And "doubly_list.c" that contains main function.
- These 2 files are written and executed in CentOS, therefore to compile and run it requires some commands they are mentioned below
- To create a file with header file extention
      - $vi doubly_list.h      //This contains all funciton
      - $vi doubly_list.c      //This contains main function
- To compile the program
      - $cc doubly_list.c -o double_list
- To run the program
      - $./double_list
- "double_list" is called the output file.
